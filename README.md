The blackjack demo can be run in simple mode or interactive mode.

In the simple mode (MainSimple.java) it:
* reads cards definition file (optional)
* create a card deck with random order of cards
* create a player and a dealer
* create a table and plays one game on that table with all events pre-defined.
* prints the result

In the interactive mode (Main.java) a embedded jetty server is started and 
it uses Vaadin to generate UI, available at http://localhost:8585.
